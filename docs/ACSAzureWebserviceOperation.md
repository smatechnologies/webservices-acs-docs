# ACSAzureWebservices Operation

Once the sma.acs.ACSAzureWebservices plugin has been registered with the OpCon system, it will be possible to perform agent and task definitions.
All definitions can only be performed using Solution Manager.

## Defining ACSAzureWebservices connection

The Agent definition is defined by adding a new ACSAzureWebservices Agent definition using Solution Manager.
Items defined in red are required values.

![Defining a Connection](../static/img/azure-ws-agent.png)

1.  Open Solution Manager.
2.  From the Home page select **Library**
3.  From the ***Administration*** Menu select **Agents**.
4.  Select **+Add** to add a new agent definition.
5.  Fill in the agent details
    - Insert a unique name for the connection.
    - Select **ACSAzureWebservices** from the **Type** drop-down list.
    - Select **ACSAzureWebservices Settings**
    - The **Azure URL** field contains a default value ***azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status*** which is used as a heartbeat to check if the Azure environment is available. 
6.  Save the definition changes. 
7.  Start the connection by selecting the **Change Communication Status** button and selecting **Enable Full Comm.**. 

## Defining tasks

The ACSAzureWebservices Connection supports the following task types:

TaskType             | Description
---------------------|------------
GetOAuth2Token       | Get an OAuth2 token 
GetPatToken          | Create a Azure DevOps authentication token using a PAT (Personal Access Token)
RunDevOpsPipeline    | Starts an Azure DevOps pipeline and monitors for completion
DownloadBlobStorage  | Download a file from Azure Blob Storage
UploadBlobStorage    | Upload a file to Azure Blob Storage

Before defining a **RunDevOpsPipeline** task, a **GetPatToken** task must be defined to create the authorization token required by the RunDevOpsPipeline Task. Similarly before defining the **DownloadBlobStorage** or **UploadBlobStorage** tasks a **GetOAuth2Token** must be defines to create the autherization task required by the DownloadBlobStorage and UploadBlobStorage tasks.

The generated authentication tasks (GetPatToken, GetOAuth2Token) store the generated token as schedule instance properties of the schedule. These properties are then available for subsequent tasks in the schedule. 

### GetOAuth2Token Task

The GetOAuth2Token task is used to get an OAuth2 token and set it as a schedule instance property so it can be used to provide authentication by subsequent Azure tasks.
